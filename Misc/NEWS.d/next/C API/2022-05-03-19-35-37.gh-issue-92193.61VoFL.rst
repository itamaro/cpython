CPython extensions providing optimized execution of Python bytecode (like Cinder JIT and Pyjion)
can benefit from being able to modify the vectorcall field on instances of PyFunctionObject to allow calling the optimized path (e.g. JIT-compiled) directly.

This PR introduces an API call where vectorcall field can be modified like so:

`void PyFunction_SetVectorcall(PyFunctionObject *func, vectorcallfunc vectorcall);`
